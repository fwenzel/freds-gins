I'm Mr. Fred and I have a modest collection of [gins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin). I'm also somewhat of a nerd, so I made this little site to keep track of my collection.

I am no professional gin sommelier (is that a thing one can be?)... and you will probably disagree with the way I make Martinis -- you are allowed to be wrong, after all. So take all this with a grain of salt and a sense of humor. Life's too short for taking oneself too seriously and most certainly for bad drinks.

If you have any comments or questions, feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/fwenzel) or [toot](https://foo.sx/@fred) at me.

This place is for fun, not profit. Always drink responsibly, my friends.
