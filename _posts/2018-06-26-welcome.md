I'm Mr. Fred and I have a modest collection of [gins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin). I'm also somewhat of a nerd and like writing code, so I made this little [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site to keep track of my collection.

If you have any comments or questions, feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/fwenzel) or [toot](https://foo.sx/@fred) at me.

This place is for fun, not profit. Always drink responsibly, my friends, quality over quantity.
