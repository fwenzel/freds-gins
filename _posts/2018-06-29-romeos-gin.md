Here's a gin from Montreal that I picked up when I visited the city last year.

It's a London Dry, with a relatively gentle combination of botanicals:

* Juniper
* Cucumber
* Dill
* Lavender
* Almond
* Lemon

I was surprised the [distillery's website](http://romeosgin.com/?lang=en) doesn't really talk about the spirit as much as about the art on it. The bottles design highlights different artists from Montreal, this one, "edition 1", has a stylized Amadeus Mozart portrait on it. Usually when the bottle is too extravagantly designed, I shy away because I suspect the bottle, not the contents, are the most noteworthy piece of the ensemble. Still, since I tend to buy local things when I travel, I gave this one a shot -- and remain on the fence. Decent gin, but nothing groundbreaking.

Overall, the main note I would describe Romeo's Gin with is *citrus*, so I decided to double down on it a bit in the drink I made, by adding a few orange bitters to the mix. Finally, since this is clearly a French-Canadian product, I used Lillet, which I figured would be less distracting from the citrus notes I wanted to prevail.

I present to you:

## Francophone Orange Bitters Martini
* 3 oz Romeo's gin
* 1/2 oz Lillet
* orange bitters

Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Pour in gin and lillet, and add a couple shakes of orange bitters. Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with an orange twist, if you like. Sant√©!

## Verdict

Not offensive enough for me to hide it in the back of the cabinet, but also the kind that I won't be rebuying when it's empty. Just sort of okay.
