Today I wanted something slightly more bitter, so I dug through my collection to find an appropriate gin, not too opinionated (or expensive). Here's what I found.

<a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/1782-cpr-distillery-spirits">Gables Gin</a> is made by McMenamins (*the* chain of brew pubs in Oregon) at their Cornelius Pass Roadhouse location (hence, *C.P.R. Distillery*).

From the makers:

> This handcrafted, small-batch gin is made in a century old Alambic still, which captures the delicate flavors and aromas from a carefully selected blend of imported and homegrown botanicals.
>
> Made from a base of organic wheat alcohol, this also features eight botanicals: Juniper, Coriander, Orris Root, Oregon Grape Root, Sage, Chocolate Mint, Rose and Yarrow. The resulting gin is full bodied and floral with flavors of juniper, citrus and rose.
>
> We bottled this at 88 proof (44% alcohol), which seems appropriate â€“ there are eight botanicals and the distillery view is of an eight-sided barn.

The gin itself is soft, floral, and inoffensive, which makes it both great for a casual martini and in a cocktail of choice.

And so, looking for a little inspiration online I found a *Hanky Panky* which combines gin and plentiful sweet vermouth to hide the aggressiveness of Fernet Branca.

Instead, I used **Kashmiri Amaro**, another outstanding local creation, an amaro made with Indian Chai:

... and turned it into:

## Kashmiri Hanky Panky
* 2 oz Gables Gin
* 1/2 to 1 oz sweet red vermouth
* 1 oz Kashmiri Amaro

If you're not afraid of the bitterness, don't hide it and go easy on the vermouth.

Stir over ice, strain into a coupe glass. Enjoy.

Can't go wrong with it.
