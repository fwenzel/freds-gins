What's Old Tom Gin? Take it from the [distillery](https://www.ransomspirits.com/spirits):
> This Old Tom Gin is a historically accurate revival of the predominant Gin in fashion during the mid 1800's and the golden age of American cocktails. The recipe was developed in collaboration with historian, author, and mixologist extraordinaire David Wondrich. Old Tom is the Gin for mixing classic cocktails dating from the days before prohibition. Its subtle maltiness is the result of using a base wort of malted barley, combined with an infusion of botanicals in high proof corn spirits. The final distillation is run through an alambic pot still in order to preserve the maximum amount of aromatics, flavor and body. Only the "heart of the hearts" (the very best portion of distillate) is retained for this special bottling.

If this looks nothing like a gin, more like a whiskey, that might just be because it is. It doesn't even smell like gin. It's malty, casky, and it'll probably treat you well in any cocktail you'd usually use a whiskey for. Like the Martinez, which looks oddly like a Manhattan and is just as tasty. It usually has Maraschino liqueur too, which I didn't have, so I underscored the caskiness with barrel-aged bitters. Recommended.

## Martinez
* 1.5oz Ransom Old Tom gin
* 1.5oz red vermouth
* 2 dashes The Bitter Housewife Bull Run Barrel-aged Bitters

Shake over ice, serve neat. Drink seated in a heavy leather chair in the sitting room of a 19th century mansion.
