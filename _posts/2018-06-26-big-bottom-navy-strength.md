Let's start with one of my local favorites. [Big Bottom](http://www.bigbottomdistilling.com/) is a small-batch distillery in Hillsboro, Oregon. They have several gins, this one, called simply "Navy Strength", is the strongest, at a solid 57% ABV (114 proof).

I like this one for two reasons. For starters, it's a nice northwest style (hence, heavier on the botanicals), but does not do anything too crazy, so it'll fare well in most drinks you might want a gin for, without the danger of the drowning out the character of the drink.

From the distillery:

>  Big Bottom Navy Strength Gin is a 114 proof gin containing the same 16 botanicals as the 91 proof gin. It presents a slightly heavier juniper bouquet than the 91 gin with a delicate hint of lemon grass and citrus. This Navy Strength Gin offers a balanced spice throughout the palate followed by a mild heat and crisp finish. Big Bottom Navy Strength Gin was awarded a Bronze Medal at the 2015 Washington Cup Spirits Competition and a Bronze Medal at the 2015 Great American Spirits Festival. It also placed Bronze for the 2017 Best of the NW: Sip NW Spirits Competition for Best Gin.

In general, I've taken a liking in Navy strength gins. Not sure what the accuracy of this is, but most of them claim it was the rule on Royal Navy ships in the 1700s to carry gin strong enough to ignite gunpowder. I haven't tried -- I want to set neither my tasty drink nor my house on fire -- but let it be known that this stuff is punchy, though thankfully not too harsh.

I suggest you drink it as a wet-ish martini, up. Feel free to be generous on the vermouth, I promise you the gin won't be easy to miss either way.

## Navy Martini, no frills
* 3 oz Navy Strength Gin
* 3/4 oz extra dry vermouth

Stir over ice. Serve with a smile.
