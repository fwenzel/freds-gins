Another one of my favorites. I picked it up in Ireland.

Drumshanbo boasts "oriental botanicals" ([to be precise](https://drumshanbogunpowderirishgin.com/the-botanical-trail): Meadowsweet, Juniper, Angelica, Caraway, Gunpowder Tea, Grapefruit, Cardamom, Coriander, Orris Root, Star Anise, Chinese Lemon, Kaffir Lime).

Wait what, tea? -- What a splendid thing to add (and this is not the only gin in my collection with tea in it). Drumshanbo is herbal, finely balanced and smooth. The tea's tannins combine with the other flavors into nothing short of a symphony.

I pondered what to mix this into, and then I couldn't really bear the thought of watering this thing down, so:

## Churchill's Martini
* 3 oz Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin
* Vermouth

Stir gin over ice, pour into a jug and then glance briefly at a vermouth bottle across the room. Drink with the conviction of a great statesman.

## Verdict

With great sadness I must inform you that after the drink I mixed for this blog post, my bottle of Drumshanbo is now empty. Urgent trip to Ireland, anyone?
