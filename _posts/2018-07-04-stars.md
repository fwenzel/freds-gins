What would the Internet be without the impulsive attempt to compare the incomparable, casually applying entirely arbitrary rating scales with an air of certainty?

Let me give you an idea what the stars mean that I assign to the different gins I showcase on this site.

![1 star](/assets/star1.png)

**1 Star?** A gin like this would be an abomination, scarcely better than rubbing alcohol (though offensively more expensive) and will, if the universe has any mercy at all, never find its way into my cabinet, let alone my glass.

**2 Stars**, we're warming up. This is probably where some of the staples of gin land fall. Fairly decent, inoffensive, and notably, two star gins can be drowned in a bucket of *supermarket brand tonic* and ice without making me cry.

**3 stars**. Tough category. This kind of gin might have an edge that I like, but not enough that I would buy it again.

![4 stars](/assets/star4.png)

**4 stars**. A category full of wonderful gins. When I have a chance to taste test a new gin, and end up bringing it home, there's a good chance it'll be at least 4 stars.

![5 stars](/assets/star5.png)

**5 stars**. The clouds parted and a ray of heavenly sunshine descended upon a blessed juniper tree, which turned into this truly one of a kind gin.
