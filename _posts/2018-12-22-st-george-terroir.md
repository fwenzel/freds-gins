As I was researching which gin I might buy next, I stumbled across a list of [most underrated gins](https://proof.media/most-underrated-gins) which has a couple of contenders.

I was intrigued by [St George's three gins](http://www.stgeorgespirits.com/spirits/gins/), in particular the *Terroir* variety, which was described as *earthy and heavily botanical*.

St George is a distillery in Alameda, California.

[From the makers](http://www.stgeorgespirits.com/spirits/gins/st-george-terroir-gin/):

> An ode to the wild beauty of the Golden State.
>
> Terroir is a forest in your glassâ€”with ultra woodsy notes of Douglas fir, California bay laurel, sage, and a hint of citrus.

I expected a bit of earthiness, but this description is an understatement of *how much* of a forest you'll be drinking. The most prominent flavor is Douglas fir, which develops a bouquet of tree sap (I am not kidding), and lingers for a long time on the palate.

That's entirely delightful, not only because it is Christmastime, but also because it reminds me of how much I like to spend time in the forest.

This isn't the first "piney" gin in my collection, but this one is remarkable in just how much like an *American* forest it tastes. The European foresty gins I have taste, well, European, and more like needles and much less like sappy wood.

I see a comparative tasting in my future!

## Verdict

A fascinating gin. Top shelf.
