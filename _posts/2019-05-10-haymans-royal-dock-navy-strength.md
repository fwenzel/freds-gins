This is a UK gin, though I bought it in Oregon. As a Navy Strength gin, it's not for the faint of heart, and that's exactly why I liked it enough to send my friend in Germany a bottle, and I quote, to _"help him grow some hair on his chest"_. If he did, and if I helped, I do not care to know.

But back to Hayman's.

Founded in 1863, the distillery is one of two dozen or so in London and has a variety of traditional styles available. This one, the 57% ABV Navy Strength, is beautifully balanced despite its punch, heavy on the juniper and coriander with warmth but no burn.

[From the distillery:](https://www.haymansgin.com/royal-dock-gin)

> First supplied to the English Admiralty in 1863, we still make our Navy Strength Royal Dock Gin in London to this day. The style is bright and bracing but not at all overpowering with a brilliant balance of juniper, coriander and citrus and a softly nuanced mouthfeel.
>
> Bottled at a traditional Navy Strength of 57% ABV, this hearty style of gin is suited perfectly to mixing a classic Pink Gin. Also wonderful in a traditional True English Gimlet, originally mixed by combining the sailors’ daily tot of gin with the lime ration provided to fight off scurvy.

I decided to have my favorite, a vesper (which in the 50s [used to be stronger](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgkgey/the-30-year-quest-to-recreate-james-bonds-original-vesper-martini) anyway, and that's why I like to make it with Navy strength gins).

Splendid, just splendid.


## Verdict

Probably my favorite at this strength. It's a fine art to deliver this flavor without the harshness, and Hayman's has got it down. Well done.
