Normally, I don't tend to pick up many of the biggest names in gin land (sorry, Beefeater fans), but this one intrigued me, as it is a special edition and it promised juniper-forward recipe. And if I didn't like a little extra juniper, why am I buying gin again?

From the distillery:

> For the newest limited edition release of Tanqueray, the juniper-forward Tanqueray Bloomsbury London Dry Gin, Master Distiller Tom Nichol drew inspiration from a recipe created by Charles Tanquerayâ€™s son, Charles Waugh Tanqueray. In 1868, when Charles died, his son Charles Waugh Tanqueray took over his business. He was only 20 years at the time, but was a brilliant businessman and innovator just like his father.
>
> His original recipe on which Tanqueray Bloomsbury was based dates back to around 1880, when the distillery was located in Bloomsbury, England. The new Tanqueray Bloomsbury gin will launch into the on-trade with limited availability at specialty retailers. The launch of Tanqueray Bloomsbury follows the successful release of Tanqueray Old Tom in 2014 and Tanqueray Malacca in 2013.

Bloomsbury comes across as a relatively simple gin, delivering on its juniper promise, but otherwise no particular surprises, good or bad. And even though it does have some of the harshness that's pretty common in the big commercial gins, I do not regret buying it.

Simple gin, simple drink: Let's add some salt (from olive brine) to bring out the juniper. No vermouth, it just distracts.

## Dirty Martini, Juniper-Forward
* 3 oz Bloomsbury dry gin
* .5 oz olive brine

Shake over ice. Garnish with olives. Sip like a fancy Englishman.
