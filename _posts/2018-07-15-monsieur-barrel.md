This is a fun one. Monsieur gin is an small-batch gin made by a tiny distillery on an organic farm in my German home state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. My dad mail-ordered it for me as a gift (thank you!).

This distillery makes different gins, this one is barrel aged in oak barrels, and comes at a solid 47% ABV / 94 proof.

From the [distillery](https://www.domaene-homburgerhof.de/destillerie/) (translation: mine):

> In our royal distillery, our gin is made in a wood-fired copper kettle [...]. Juniper gives this gin its main note. Cardamom, lemon peel, lemon verbena, whole lemons, rose blossoms, lavender, lemon balm, rosemary, tarragon, mint, lingonberry, and other botanicals and spices round out the flavor.

I'll write more about the non-barrel-aged version of this gin soon enough, but this one has a beautifully herby bouquet that opens up into mild licorice notes and quickly rounds out into a nice and soft oak barrel aroma.

(I sound like a total gin snob, don't I. Oops.)

The result is an extremely fine gin that'll play well in most classic cocktails while maintaining its own unique character. Here's a negroni:

## Classic Negroni, Barrel-aged
Equal parts:
* Monsieur Gin, barrel-Aged
* Campari
* Red vermouth

Stir over ice, serve on the rocks. Orange twist won't hurt.

An absolutely outstanding gin.
