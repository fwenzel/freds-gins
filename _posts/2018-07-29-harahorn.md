Adding to the list of gins that traveled a long ways towards me on an airplane. My brother got it for me in Oslo. :)

Harahorn gin is a small batch craft gin from Grimstad, a small town on the south coast of Norway.

From the [distillery](https://detnorskebrenneri.no/en/products/harahorn/):

> We only produce 400 litres at a time – so as to retain total control of quality. We use only berries and herbs from the wilds of Norway – among the world’s most flavoursome. This is a potent gin, at 46% proof. Perfect for mixed drinks and cocktails. Harahorn Gin – named after a mountain in Hemsedal, and inspired by a fabled horned hare never yet seen by human eyes …
Contains juniper berries from Røros, blueberries from Nordmarka, rhubarb and bladderwrack from Grimstad, angelica from Oppdal and wild marjoram from Sunndal.

Can confirm the outstanding quality: Harahorn is finely herby, and I'd say angelica is its most distinct note, which I quite like. Or the [bladderwrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucus_vesiculosus) maybe, but I don't know what European seaweed tastes like...

I had it as a classic martini, but think this gin would do just as well in a fine gin and tonic.
