If you're thinking, wait, Riesling is not what should be in a gin, you're probably right. But hey........


Fine in a mixed drink where the wine notes can shine, not distract. Such as the summer drink ......

## Blackberry-Basil Gin Fizz
* 2 oz Ferdinand's Saar Dry Gin
* 1 oz fresh lime juice
* 1/4 oz simple syrup
* 4 blackberries
* 2 fresh lemon basil leaves
* Club soda
* lime wedge, for garnish

1. Fill a rocks glass with ice.
2. Combine the ingredients in cocktail shaker. Muddle to get the fruit juice out of the berries.
3. Pour into the rocks glass, top with club soda.
4. Garnish with lime wedge, some more blackberries and a sprig of lemon basil.

## Verdict
