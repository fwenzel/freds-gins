In a shocking turn of events, no martini for me today. Instead, I went the softer route and got out one of my Old Tom gins. This one is local, from [New Deal Distillery](https://newdealdistillery.com/) in Portland. Their Old Tom appears to be a limited edition, and I cannot find it on their website anymore. Well, well, well.

Old Tom, as Wikipedia [reminds us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Tom_gin), is _sweeter than London Dry, but slightly drier than the Dutch Jenever, thus is sometimes called "the missing link"._

I assure you this is _a lot_ sweeter than a London Dry, and I bought it precisely because of its buttery smoothness -- if this thing could play the sax, it'd make Kenny G sound like bebop. The cask aroma has taken away any harshness there might have been.

Appropriately, I made a Martinez cocktail. [Jerry Thomas' 1887 _Bartender's Guide_](https://archive.org/details/bartendersguideo00thom/page/25) describes it as:

> **Martinez Cocktail.**
>
> (Use small bar-glass.)
>
> * Take 1 dash of Boker's bitters.
> * 2 dashes of Maraschino.
> * 1 pony of Old Tom gin.
> * 1 wine-glass of Vermouth.
> * 2 small lumps of ice.
>
> Shake up thoroughly, and strain into a large cock-
tail glass. Put a quarter of a slice of lemon in the
glass, and serve. If the guest prefers it very sweet,
add two dashes of gum syrup.

Delicious!

## Verdict

I am not even a fan of Old Toms, given how much I usually enjoy bone dry martinis. But this one is a special treat. Well done, New Deal.
