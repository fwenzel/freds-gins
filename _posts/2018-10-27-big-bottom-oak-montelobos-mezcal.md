Today's post is a two-for-one and one isn't even a gin, gasp!

First things first, the [Big Bottom Barrel-Finished Gin](http://www.bigbottomdistilling.com/barrel-finished-gin.php) is from the same local distillery as the [Navy Strength I previously discussed](/2018-06-26/big-bottom-navy-strength).

While the Navy Strength is pretty punchy, this one is smooth as butter, if only a little meek, as if it wanted to have a deep character, but not enough to risk offense. It is pleasant, but less remarkable than it could be.

Fortunately, I gave it a friend.

Montelobos Mezcal is from Oaxaca and I don't even know where to start. Made from organic espad√≠n agave, beautifully smoky and smooth.

The two of them came together for a lovely mezcal martini:

## Mezcal Martini
* 1 part Montelobos mezcal
* 3 parts Oak-barrel finished gin
* 1 part dry vermouth

Stir with ice. Strain into martini glass. Sip.
